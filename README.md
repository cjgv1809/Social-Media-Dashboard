This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Title

_Social Media Dashboard_

### Prerequisites üìã

_Install previously Nodejs(LTS) for the installation of the different packages to be used in the project through npm(Node Package Manager) and Firebase Tools CLI in case you want to use it for deployment_

### Installation üîß

_Download or clone this project using git clone command + url of the project_<br />
_Open the command line on Visual Studio Code or in your code editor of your choice and execute the command "npm install" to install al the dependencies needed_<br />
_Once installed all the dependencies, run the command "npm start" to start the server in the development mode_<br />
_Once you are done with the development, execute the command "npm run build" to prepare the app for production mode and for optimizing its performance_<br />
_Once this is step is finished, to deploy the app we can use "firebase login" to login to your gmail account, having previously installed the firebase tools running "npm install -g firebase-tools"_<br />
_After that, we can run the command "firebase init" to initialize the service following the instructions given by the CLI and selecting Hosting and using as your public directory the folder "build" generated by the command npm run build and setting it as a SPA_<br />
_Finally we are ready to deploy the website using "firebase deploy"_<br />

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Styling :nail_care:

This project is built entirely with CSS pure, using mostly Grid and Flexbox for the layout. It's fully responsive thanks to the grid system used changing and adjusting rows and columns from bigger(Desktop) to smaller screens(Phones). Most of them were used through media queries to adjust the resolution according to the viewport of the user's screen. On the other hand, the modal component used was provided by Material UI framework and some animations were added to it like transition, and React-Reveal package for the big and small cards.
